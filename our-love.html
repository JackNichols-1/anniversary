      <p>
        More than a year with my love. My complex, passion filled love. <br><br>

You have so many fine qualities, I don't think I can even write down some of the more nuanced details that makes my heart melt. You have all the personalities I've sought for all in one impeccable package. You have an easy going nature filled with laughter and smiles that is so cute and heart warming and it really keeps me going everyday. Combined with this present perfection, I see a perfect personality for the future. Your stern, big fire lends itself to help when times get hard. Hard times come for all and I believe I will be stronger in these with you by my side. I've seen this very reflective already with support I would never believe I could get - I know we have each other's backs. You may be big fire, but you are my big fire.<br><br>


I love your wifey energy in a big way and it's hot. Like really hot. You know what you want and you find your way. It lends you caring qualities that make you such a high level girlfriend. Your cooking game is on point, and it has really captured my heart but it’s the way you put everything aside to care for me when I was ill that showed me your love. I know you’ll always be there for me.<br><br>

I feel as if I’ve already been married to you for a long time. That’s how natural and comfortable being with you feels. From the very beginning, I felt at home with you, even after just a few months. And to then survive a whole year of long distance, beating all the odds of distance and language, makes what we have even more special. I love every moment we spend together and all the weird and wonderful things we’ve done. We burn so brightly together, and I never thought I’d find someone so perfectly on the same page as me from attitude and outlook on life, to future dreams, to deep talks and playful moments. I love you, completely.<br><br>

You've opened up to me and made me yours. My devil girl that pulled me in, has shown her sweet baby real side. I hope to be able to lift you up and support you with anything I promise to hold and cherish you forever. You are different, but in a special way to me. My perfect. I couldn't without you. Here’s to one beautiful year of calling you mine, and to many more years by your side.<br><br>

Love,<br>
Jack
